# Hidden-Prime-Number-Extractor-Binary-Substring-Analysis-
This project is a Python program that searches a binary string to find all hidden prime numbers contained within its substrings. The script takes every possible substring of a binary input, converts it into decimal form, checks whether the value is a prime number, and returns all unique primes found within a given limit.

The project demonstrates algorithmic thinking, binary-to-decimal conversion, and the implementation of an optimized primality test. It also includes execution-time measurement to show the performance of the algorithm on large inputs.

The program was designed as a practical exercise to improve skills in Python, mathematical logic, and performance-aware programming.
